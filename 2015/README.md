## QuickBasic
.bas files are writte in QuickBasic. They might or might not be compatible with qb4.5, but they work in [qb64](https://qb64.org/).

## JavaScript (Node.js)
* Install `npm install`.
* Run .js files with node: `node ./09.js`.
* Alternatively, use `npm run bin` with a list of day numbers, for example `npm run bin 9 10 11` will run days 9, 10, 11.
* Execute tests with `npm test`.
* To run a single test `npm test -- 13.test.js`.
