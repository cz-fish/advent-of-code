## Loop rewrite

Code from beginning to label `Y` is only executed once at startup. The two loops multiply the initial value of `c` and `b`, which is `15 * 170 = 2550`. This is added to initial value of `a` (solution) and stored in `d` and `d` never changes afterwards.

`d = INPUT + 15 * 170`

```
d = _input + 2550
do { // Y
    a = d
    do { // X
        b = a
        a = 0
        do { // D
            c = 2
            do { // C
                if b == 0 {
                    break 2 levels
                }
                b--
                c--
            } while c != 0
            a++
        } while (true)
        // E
        b = 2
        do { // F
            if c == 0 {
                break
            }
            b--
            c--
        } while (true)
        // G
        print(b)
    } while (a != 0)
} while(true)
```

## Simplify code

The code between `E` and `G` is computing `b = 2 - c`. The code between `X` and `E` is similar but more complex. It divides `b` by 2 and stores the result in `a`. But `c` will retain the modulus of the division, although instead of having the values 1 or 0, it will have the values 1 or 2. That is why the loop between `E` and `G` then adjusts the value to 1 or 0.

```
d = _input + 2550
do { // Y
    a = d
    do { // X
        b = a

        a = b // 2
        c = b mod 2 ? 1 : 2

        // E
        b = 2-c
        c = 0
        // G
        print(b)
    } while (a != 0)
} while(true)
```

In all, the code computes a value `d`, and then takes each bit of this number, from lowest to highest, and outputs one bit at a time. When it runs out of bits, the program jumps back to the beginning (label `Y`) and continues.  To satisfy the output pattern, we need `d` to be `0b101010101010` (alternating 1s and 0s). We achieve that by choosing the right input value:

```
ans = 0b101010101010 - bin(2550) = 180
```
